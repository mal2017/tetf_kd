# TETF_KD

This repo includes code for processing of knockdown experiments for Ellison Lab TETF project.

It uses snakemake modules hosted on github. Some of these expect a particular directory structure above the working directory, so this repo will likely not run on its own - it must be a subworkflow of `mal2017/tetf`.
